Binary index tree, also called [Fenwick Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree), can provide both O(log n) time complexity for modifying an element or caculating prefix sum of a table. And it's easy to implement :D  
The one-based version is a little weird, so I also implemented the zero-based one. Both versions only contains a few important methods, methods like size() and pop_back() are not implemented.  
Referred to [An article on Fenwick Trees on Algorithmist](http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Fenwick_tree.) when writing the zero-based version.
